This code leverages the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection framework, implemented with OpenCV and NumPy, to create a vehicle detection and lane marking analysis system. 
The primary goal is to enhance road safety by identifying vehicles and potential collisions in real-time, making it suitable for applications in traffic monitoring and accident prevention.

The YOLOv3 model, trained on the COCO dataset, is used to detect specific vehicle classes, including cars, motorbikes, buses, and trucks, 
with adjustable confidence thresholds to filter out unreliable detections. This model operates effectively within a deep learning context, allowing for real-time analysis of video feeds.

The collision detection feature is implemented through a bounding box intersection algorithm, which checks for overlaps between detected vehicle bounding boxes. By using this simple yet effective method,
the system can identify potential accidents and provide timely information for traffic management, thus contributing to improved road safety
